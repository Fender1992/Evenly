  "household_id": "uuid",
  "to_user_id": "uuid",
  "amount": 125.50,
  "method": "venmo",
  "reference": "optional-ref",
  "note": "Coffee this week"
}
```

**Response:** 201 Created with settlement object

**Notes:**

---

## Database Integration

### Tables Used

**`settlement`**: Primary settlement storage (from Phase 1)
```sql
CREATE TABLE settlement (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  household_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES household(id),
  from_user_id UUID NOT NULL,
  to_user_id UUID NOT NULL,
  amount NUMERIC(12,2) NOT NULL,
  method TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (method IN ('venmo', 'zelle', 'cashapp', 'cash', 'other')),
  reference TEXT,
  note TEXT,
  settled_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

**Other tables queried:**
- `membership`: Authorization and user lookup
- `audit_log`: Settlement action logging
- `auth.users`: User profile information (via Supabase Admin API)

### RLS Policies (from Phase 1)

**Select Policy:**
```sql
CREATE POLICY settlement_select_policy ON settlement
  FOR SELECT
  USING (is_household_member(household_id));
```

**Insert Policy:**
```sql
CREATE POLICY settlement_insert_policy ON settlement
  FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (
    is_household_member(household_id)
    AND (from_user_id = auth.uid() OR to_user_id = auth.uid())
  );
```

**No Update/Delete**: Settlements are immutable by design

---

## User Experience Highlights

### Visual Design

**Color Language:**
- **Blue**: Primary actions (record settlement button)
- **Red**: Negative balance / paid settlements
- **Green**: Positive balance / received settlements
- **Gray**: Neutral state (all settled up)

**Layout:**
- Prominent balance display
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Consistent card-based design
- Shadow effects for depth

### Interaction Patterns

**Payment Flow:**
1. User sees balance on home screen or settlements tab
2. Taps "Record Settlement" button
3. Modal opens with pre-determined direction
4. Enters amount (or taps "Full" for complete settlement)
5. Selects payment method
6. Optionally adds note
7. Taps "Record"
8. Confirmation and immediate UI update

**Settlement History:**
- Pull-to-refresh for manual updates
- Chronological scroll
- Clear from/to indicators
- Method and note display

### Information Architecture

1. **Critical**: Current net balance (large, prominent)
2. **Important**: Record settlement button (conditional)
3. **Secondary**: Balance breakdown
4. **Tertiary**: Settlement history

---

## Navigation Integration

### Tab Bar Updates
**Before Phase 7:** 5 tabs
- Home, Transactions, Budgets, Rules, Settings

**After Phase 7:** 6 tabs
- Home, Transactions, **Settlements**, Budgets, Rules, Settings

**Design Decision:**
- Settlements placed between Transactions and Budgets
- Core feature deserving prominent tab placement
- "Settle Up" label more action-oriented than "Settlements"
- Swap icon clearly communicates payment exchange

### Deep Linking
- Home screen "Settle Up" button → `/settlements`
- Direct navigation from balance display
- Seamless user flow across screens

---

## Security & Authorization

### Authentication
- All endpoints require Bearer token
- Supabase Auth session validation
- Automatic user identification

### Authorization Checks
1. **Household Membership**: User must be member of household
2. **Recipient Validation**: to_user_id must also be household member
3. **Ownership**: from_user_id automatically set to authenticated user
4. **RLS Enforcement**: Database-level access control

### Input Validation
- Required fields: household_id, to_user_id, amount, method
- Method enum validation (venmo/zelle/cashapp/cash/other)
- Positive amount validation
- User ID format validation

### Audit Trail
- All settlements logged with metadata
- Immutable records prevent tampering
- User and household context captured
- Timestamp for all operations

## Testing Recommendations

### Unit Tests (To Be Added in Phase 9)
- Settlement creation with valid data
- Direction detection logic
- Amount validation
- Payment method validation
- User display name extraction

### Integration Tests (To Be Added in Phase 9)
- GET settlements endpoint
- POST settlement endpoint
- Authorization checks
- User profile population
- Cache invalidation

### Manual Testing Checklist
- ✅ View settlements tab
- ✅ See current net balance
- ✅ Record settlement (I owe partner)
- ✅ Record settlement (partner owes me)
- ✅ Record settlement with full amount
- ✅ Record settlement with partial amount
- ✅ Select different payment methods
- ✅ Add optional note
- ✅ View settlement history
- ✅ Pull to refresh settlements
- ✅ Navigate from home screen button
- ✅ Verify balance updates after settlement
- ✅ Test with zero balance (settled up state)
- ✅ Verify unauthorized access blocked
- ✅ Check empty state display

---

## Performance Considerations

### Query Optimization
- **Indexed Queries**: household_id, from_user_id, to_user_id all indexed
- **Efficient Ordering**: settled_at descending for history
- **Minimal Joins**: User profiles fetched separately (could be optimized)
- **Pagination Ready**: FlatList supports infinite scroll if needed

### Caching Strategy
- **React Query Cache**: 30-second stale time
- **Automatic Invalidation**: On settlement creation
- **Manual Refresh**: Pull-to-refresh available
- **Household Summary Sync**: Invalidates on settlement to update balances

### Network Efficiency
- **Single Request**: All settlements fetched at once
- **User Profile Caching**: Could implement client-side user cache
- **Compact Payloads**: Only necessary fields returned
- **Conditional Loading**: Only fetches when household ID available

---

## Known Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations
1. **No Partial Payment Tracking**: Can't split one debt into multiple partial payments with tracking
2. **Two-Person Households Only**: UI assumes one partner (works for couples)
3. **No Settlement Editing**: Immutable design prevents corrections
4. **No Settlement Deletion**: Can't remove mistaken entries
5. **No Settlement Verification**: Both parties can't confirm settlement
6. **No Receipt Attachments**: Can't upload payment proof
7. **User Profiles from Admin API**: Inefficient for user name lookup
8. **No Push Notifications**: No reminders for outstanding balances

### Planned for Future Phases
- **Phase 8**: Pro features
  - Receipt attachments
  - Settlement verification/confirmation
  - Recurring settlement reminders
- **Phase 9**: App hardening
  - Settlement edit within time window (e.g., 5 minutes)
  - Settlement dispute resolution
  - Better user profile caching
  - Multi-person household support
- **Phase 10**: Documentation
  - Settlement best practices guide
  - Payment method integration guides

---

---

## Dependencies

No new dependencies added in Phase 7. Uses existing libraries:
- `@tanstack/react-query`: Data fetching and caching
- `react-native`: Core UI components
- `expo-router`: Navigation
- `@expo/vector-icons`: Icons
- `@supabase/supabase-js`: Database and auth

---

## Migration Path

No database migrations required for Phase 7. The `settlement` table created in Phase 1 was sufficient. RLS policies also already in place.

**Existing schema leveraged:**
```sql
-- From Phase 1 migration
CREATE TABLE settlement (...);
CREATE POLICY settlement_select_policy (...);
CREATE POLICY settlement_insert_policy (...);
```

- Added "Settle Up" button for quick access
- Conditional rendering based on balance

### Split Ledger
- Settlements are separate from split_ledger entries
- split_ledger tracks who owes what from transactions
- settlement table tracks actual payments made
- Together they provide complete financial picture

---

## Ledger Integrity Verification

### Balance Calculation
**Formula:**
```
net_balance = sum(split_ledger where payee = user)
            - sum(split_ledger where payer = user)
            + sum(settlement where to_user = user)
            - sum(settlement where from_user = user)
```

### Integrity Checks (Could be added in Phase 9)
1. **Balance Reconciliation**: Verify calculated balance matches displayed balance
2. **Settlement Sum**: Verify settlements don't exceed ledger balance
3. **Timestamp Validation**: Ensure settlements are chronological
4. **Duplicate Detection**: Check for identical settlements within time window

### Audit Trail
- Every settlement creates audit_log entry
- Action: "settlement.created"
- Metadata includes: amount, method, to_user_id
- Immutable record for dispute resolution

---
