## Key Features

### 1. Real-Time Spending Calculation
- **Server-Side Calculation**: Spending is calculated on-demand by querying transactions
- **Formula**:
  - Sum all negative transactions in category during budget period
  - Calculate remaining = limit - spent
  - Calculate percentage = (spent / limit) × 100
- **Accuracy**: Only counts posted (non-pending) transactions
- **Performance**: Efficient query with proper filtering

### 2. Visual Progress Indicators
- **Three-Color System**:
  - 🟢 Green (0-79%): On track
  - 🟠 Orange (80-99%): Approaching limit
  - 🔴 Red (100%+): Over budget
- **Progress Bars**:
  - Responsive width based on percentage
  - Capped at 100% visual width
  - Smooth color transitions
- **Percentage Display**: Always shows actual percentage (can exceed 100%)

### 3. Multi-Level Alerts

#### Individual Budget Alerts
- **Over Budget (100%+)**:
  - Red warning banner
  - Shows amount exceeded
  - Warning icon
- **Approaching Limit (80-99%)**:
  - Orange caution banner
  - Shows remaining amount
  - Alert icon

#### Home Screen Alerts
- **Section Badge**: Red circular badge when any budget >= 80%
- **Overall Alert Banner**:
  - Red banner showing count of exceeded budgets
  - Orange banner showing count of approaching budgets

## Database Integration

### Tables Used
- **`budget`**: Primary budget storage
  - Fields: id, household_id, category_id, amount_limit, period_start, period_end
  - Constraints: Foreign keys to household and category
- **`transaction`**: Spending source
  - Queried for: account_id, category_id, posted_at, amount, is_pending
- **`account`**: Link transactions to household
- **`category`**: Budget categorization
- **`membership`**: Authorization checks
- **`audit_log`**: Audit trail for all budget operations

### Audit Logging
All budget operations are logged:
- **Actions**: `budget.created`, `budget.updated`, `budget.deleted`
- **Metadata**: Includes relevant changes and IDs
- **User Tracking**: Records which user performed the action
- **Household Context**: Links to household for reporting

---

## Security & Authorization

### Authentication
- All endpoints require Bearer token authentication
- Tokens validated via Supabase Auth
- Session management handled by Supabase client

### Authorization
- Household membership verification on all operations
- Users can only access budgets for their household
- Budget ownership validated before updates/deletes
- RLS policies enforce database-level isolation (existing from Phase 1)

### Input Validation
- Required field checks on budget creation
- Numeric validation for amount_limit
- Date format validation for periods
- Category and household ID validation via foreign keys

---

## User Experience Highlights

### Visual Design
- **Consistent Color Language**:
  - Blue for primary actions
  - Red for errors/warnings
  - Orange for cautions
  - Green for success/on-track
- **Card-Based Layout**: Clean, modern card design
- **Shadow Effects**: Subtle depth with elevation
- **Icon Usage**: Ionicons for clear visual communication

### Interaction Patterns
- **Pull to Refresh**: Standard mobile pattern for data refresh
- **Modal Sheets**: Native iOS-style modals for actions
- **Confirmation Dialogs**: Native Alert API for destructive actions
- **Loading States**: ActivityIndicator during data fetches
- **Empty States**: Helpful messaging with icons

### Information Hierarchy
1. **Critical**: Alert banners (red/orange)
2. **Primary**: Budget cards with progress
3. **Secondary**: Category names and limits
4. **Tertiary**: Spent amounts and percentages

## Testing Recommendations

### Unit Tests (To Be Added in Phase 9)
- Budget CRUD operations
- Spending calculation accuracy
- Percentage calculation edge cases
- Color coding logic
- Alert threshold detection

### Integration Tests (To Be Added in Phase 9)

- Audit log creation

### Manual Testing Checklist
- ✅ Create budget with valid data
- ✅ Create budget with missing fields (validation)
- ✅ View budget list with multiple budgets
- ✅ View budget progress on home screen
- ✅ Update budget amount
- ✅ Delete budget with confirmation
- ✅ Cancel budget deletion

---

## Performance Considerations

### Query Optimization
- **Indexed Queries**: Leverages existing indexes on household_id, category_id
- **Efficient Filtering**: Server-side date range filtering
- **Minimal Joins**: Only joins category table for display
- **Pagination Ready**: FlatList supports infinite scroll if needed

### Caching Strategy
- **React Query Cache**: 30-second stale time for budget data
- **Automatic Invalidation**: Cache cleared on mutations
- **Manual Refresh**: Pull-to-refresh for user-initiated updates
- **Optimistic Updates**: Could be added for instant UI feedback

### Network Efficiency
- **Single Request**: All budgets fetched in one call
- **Conditional Queries**: Only fetch when householdId is available
- **Compact Payloads**: Only necessary fields returned
- **Compressed Responses**: Next.js automatic gzip compression

---

## Known Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations
1. **No Push Notifications**: Alerts are visual only (planned for Phase 9)
2. **No Budget Sharing**: Can't share budget status with partner
3. **No Historical Trends**: No charts showing spending over time
4. **Single Currency**: Only USD supported
5. **No Rollover**: Unused budget doesn't carry to next month
6. **No Budget Templates**: Can't clone budgets month-to-month

### Planned for Future Phases
- **Phase 7**: Settlement integration with budget awareness
- **Phase 8**: Pro features (advanced budgeting, forecasting)
- **Phase 9**:
  - Push notifications for budget alerts
  - Budget templates and cloning
  - Historical trend charts
  - Multi-currency support
- **Phase 10**:
  - Budget sharing with household members
  - Budget recommendations based on spending patterns

## Dependencies Added

No new dependencies were added in Phase 6. The implementation uses existing libraries:
- `@tanstack/react-query`: Data fetching and caching
- `react-native`: Core UI components
- `expo-router`: Navigation
- `@expo/vector-icons`: Icons
- `@supabase/supabase-js`: Database and auth

---

## Migration Path

No database migrations required for Phase 6. The existing `budget` table from Phase 1 was sufficient:

```sql
CREATE TABLE budget (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  household_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES household(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  category_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES category(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  amount_limit DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
  period_start TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
  period_end TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(household_id, category_id, period_start)
);
```
